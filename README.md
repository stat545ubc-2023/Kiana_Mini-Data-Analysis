# Project Description

This is a Mini Data Analysis Project with two milestones. The learning objectives for this project are to design a research question, prepare the data, analyze the data, and develop a report. Moreover, the goal is to gain experience using *dplyr* packages for data manipulation, *ggplot2* for visualization, and *tidyverse* packages for modelling.

## **Milestone 1**

[M1 Instructions](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/mini-project/mini-project-1/)

**There are three main tasks:**

1.  Choosing a Favourite Dataset

2.  Exploring the Selected Dataset

    **There are four steps in task 2:**

    -   **Step 1:** Create a Subset of the Data
    -   **Step 2:** Identify missing values
    -   **Step 3:** Create a new variable
    -   **Step 4:** Explore Two Variables' Relationship

3.  Choose research questions
